  abstract = {The relationship between ageing and skills is becoming an important policy issue, not least in the context of population ageing. Data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) will potentially add considerably to the understanding of the relationship between ageing and foundation skills. In particular, the fact that data from the 1994-1998 International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) and the 2003-2007 Adult Literacy and Lifeskills Survey (ALL) will be linked with PIAAC offers a unique opportunity to examine trends over time at the cohort level for a wide range of countries. Specifically, repeated measures will enable an analysis of whether there is skill gain and skill loss over the lifespan of cohorts and overtime between cohorts. This is especially important because age-skill profiles observed on the basis of a single cross-section are difficult to interpret. With this as a backdrop, this paper has sought to provide an overview of what is known about age-skill profiles and to conduct an analysis that demonstrates how trend data based on repeated cross-sectional observations of direct measures of skill at the cohort level can be used to estimate skill gain and skill loss over the lifespan and over time.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In Germany, three large-scale surveys\textendash the Level One Study (LEO), the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), and the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS)\textendash provide complementary data on adults' literacy skills that can be harnessed to study adults with low literacy. To ensure that research on low-literate adults using these surveys arrives at valid and robust conclusions, it is imperative to ascertain the comparability of the three surveys' low-literacy samples. Towards that end, in the present study, we comprehensively assess the comparability of adults with low literacy across these surveys with regard to their sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics.                                         Methods               We used data from LEO, PIAAC, and NEPS. We identified features of the sample representation and measurement of (low) literacy as potential causes for variations in the low-literacy samples across the surveys. We then compared the low-literacy samples with regard to their sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics and performed logistic regressions to compare the relative importance of these characteristics as correlates of low literacy.                                         Results               The key insight our study provides is that\textendash despite different sample representations and measurement approaches\textendash the low-literacy samples in the three surveys are largely comparable in terms of their socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics. Although there were small differences between the surveys with regard to the distribution of gender, educational attainment, and the proportion of non-native speakers within the group of low-literate adults, results revealed that both the prevalence of low literacy and its correlates were largely robust across LEO, PIAAC, and NEPS. Across all three surveys, lower educational attainment emerged as the most significant correlate of low literacy, followed by a non-German language background, unemployment and low occupational status.                                         Conclusions               Our study provides evidence that all three surveys can be used for investigating adults with low literacy. The small differences between the low-literacy samples across the three surveys appear to be associated with sample representation and certain assessment features that should be kept in mind when using the surveys for research and policy purposes. Nevertheless, our study showed that we do not compare apples with oranges when dealing with low-literate adults across different large-scale surveys.},

Although evidence suggests that participation in training is related to higher literacy skills, it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal effect of training participation on literacy (training effects), results from the self-selection of more high-skilled individuals into training (selection effects), or is due to other sources of endogeneity (e.g., omitted variable bias). To unravel these possibilities, we used data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) and its German follow-up, PIAAC-Longitudinal (PIAAC-L). As these unique data offer repeated measures of literacy skills, spaced three years apart, in a large and representative sample, they allowed us to disentangle training effects from selection effects and to account for potential endogeneity. Analyses revealed that, even after taking account of formal education and a host of job characteristics, individuals with higher literacy skills were more likely to participate in training. By contrast, no evidence for effects of training on literacy skills emerged in any of our models, which comprised lagged-dependent, fixed effects, and instrumental-variable models. These findings suggest that, rather than job-related training contributing to literacy development, individuals with higher literacy skills are more likely to participate in training.},

A pilot study of 447 adults is reported that analyzed the dimensionality and difficulty of the reading competence test for adults. Results indicated that the test meets the NEPS research goals. The article focuses particularly on whether text types and cognitive requirements prove to be appropriate structural elements for the framework, that is, whether each distinguishes sufficiently between good and poor readers. Results also report on the dimensionality of the reading competence test. A comparison between one unidimensional and two different multidimensional models examined whether the text types and/or cognitive requirements of the items/tasks are separate dimensions of reading competence, or whether the reading competence measured in NEPS can \textendash{} as intended \textendash{} be conceived as a unidimensional construct. Results are discussed against the background of the scope and limitations of the NEPS reading competence test and the relevant research literature on reading competence.},

  abstract = {In 2011/2012, key adult competencies were assessed in 24 countries (including Germany) as a part of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). The German PIAAC Longitudinal Project (PIAAC-L) follows up the German PIAAC sample with three additional waves of data collection (in 2014, 2015, and 2016), each with a somewhat different focus. The PIAAC-L questionnaires are largely based on core instruments from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), but sometimes include parts of the PIAAC background questionnaire and various additional questions and modules on the respondent's background adopted from other surveys as well as a number of new questions. In addition, assessment instruments from PIAAC and NEPS (National Educational Panel Study) measuring key competencies are implemented. The objective of the PIAAC-L project is to significantly expand the German PIAAC database by adding a longitudinal dimension and by enriching the depth and breadth of information available on the German PIAAC respondents. This approach extends the analytical potential of the German PIAAC data and allows a myriad of additional research questions to be addressed. PIAAC-L is a collaborative effort undertaken by GESIS \textendash{} Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences (lead) together with the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) and the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories (LIfBi). The German PIAAC 2012 respondents that had given their consent to being re-contacted for a potential follow-up survey (anchor persons) form the starting point for PIAAC-L. In order to obtain further information on the context of these anchor persons, the PIAAC-L approach additionally includes household members ages 18+ as well as the administration of a comprehensive household questionnaire (in waves 1 and 3). The 2014 data collection (wave 1) implemented core SOEP questionnaires (for persons and households). For the 2015 data collection (wave 2), we developed an extensive background questionnaire (including items from PIAAC, NEPS, SOEP, as well as a number of other surveys). This questionnaire, followed by an assessment of literacy and numeracy using PIAAC and NEPS measurement instruments, was administered to anchor persons and their partners \textendash{} if the latter lived in the same household as the anchor. As in wave 1, the 2016 data collection once again collected interviews from all adults living in the anchor person's household using core SOEP questionnaires; the SOEP person questionnaire was extended to include new questions and modules (for example on adult education). In wave 3, respondents were also administered the SOEP short cognitive performance tasks. In addition, cognitive items from a Number Series Study carried out by the German Institute for International Educational Research (DIPF) were included as an add-on module. Data Collection 2014 Core SOEP questionnaires were implemented in the 2014 data collection. The household questionnaire includes the following topics: - Living situation, conditions and costs - Household income and benefits, wealth - Children and other household members The person questionnaire includes questions on: - Background information, family, and childhood - Biographical calendar - Formal education (general and vocational education), continuing professional education - Work status, situation and history - Income and benefits - Health, attitudes, personality, opinions, satisfaction - Time use and leisure activities Data Collection 2015 In 2015 respondents were administered first a CAPI questionnaire and then a cognitive assessment using PIAAC instruments and NEPS instruments. The person questionnaire encompasses questions from several surveys (e.g., PIAAC 2012, SOEP, NEPS, AES, or PISA) and includes the following topics: - General, vocational and professional education - Current status and employment, income - Skills used at work - Computer skill use - Mother tongue(s) and knowledge of foreign languages - Self-assessment of numeracy and literacy - Health, leisure, friends - Family and relationships - Background information (e.g., parents, citizenship) - Satisfaction The cognitive assessment implemented the following instruments: - PIAAC Literacy - PIAAC Numeracy - NEPS Reading Speed - NEPS Reading - NEPS Mathematics As in PIAAC 2012, the PIAAC assessment items were administered per default computer-based, but a paper-based version was available for respondents who could or would not work on the items on the computer. The NEPS items were paper-based only, as is usually the case in the NEPS. The design of the cognitive assessment is different for anchor persons and their partners. For the anchor persons, there were eight different assessment conditions: Two with only NEPS items, two with only PIAAC items, and four with some items from PIAAC and some from the NEPS. The partners of the anchor persons worked exclusively on NEPS items (two assessment conditions). Data Collection 2016 Core SOEP questionnaires were implemented in the 2016 data collection, with various extensions. In addition, a number of cognitive tasks were administered. The household questionnaire includes the following topics: - Living situation, conditions, and costs - Household income and benefits, wealth - Household possessions and customs - Children The person questionnaire includes questions on: - Background information, family, childhood, and cultural identity - Biographical calendar - Formal education (general and vocational education) - Adult education and training (vocational and general further training) [new module] - Work status, situation and history, skill mismatch - Income and benefits - Health, satisfaction, attitudes - Time use and leisure activities - Life events The following cognitive competencies short scales (from SOEP) were administered: - Animal naming task - Multiple-choice vocabulary intelligence test - Symbol-digit test Add-on Module: A subset of anchor persons participated in the Number Series Study (German Institute for International Educational Research, DIPF) which was carried out as a cooperative undertaking of the PIAAC-L project with the PIAAC Leibniz Network. The Number Series Study conducted by the DIPF was a part of research project within the PIAAC Leibniz Network (PIAAC-LN) and was funded by the Leibniz Community (Grant number SAW-2015-GESIS-2) and the Centre for International Student Assessment (ZIB; Grant Number ZIB2016).

  abstract = {Individual differences researchers very commonly report Pearson correlations between their variables of interest. Cohen (1988) provided guidelines for the purposes of interpreting the magnitude of a correlation, as well as estimating power. Specifically, r=0.10, r=0.30, and r=0.50 were recommended to be considered small, medium, and large in magnitude, respectively. However, Cohen's effect size guidelines were based principally upon an essentially qualitative impression, rather than a systematic, quantitative analysis of data. Consequently, the purpose of this investigation was to develop a large sample of previously published meta-analytically derived correlations which would allow for an evaluation of Cohen's guidelines from an empirical perspective. Based on 708 meta-analytically derived correlations, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlations of 0.11, 0.19, and 0.29, respectively. Based on the results, it is suggested that Cohen's correlation guidelines are too exigent, as {$<$}3\% of correlations in the literature were found to be as large as r=0.50. Consequently, in the absence of any other information, individual differences researchers are recommended to consider correlations of 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 as relatively small, typical, and relatively large, in the context of a power analysis, as well as the interpretation of statistical results from a normative perspective.},

  abstract = {Existing estimates of the labor-market returns to human capital give a distorted picture of the role of skills across different economies. International comparisons of earnings analyses rely almost exclusively on school attainment measures of human capital, and evidence incorporating direct measures of cognitive skills is mostly restricted to early-career workers in the United States. Analysis of the new PIAAC survey of adult skills over the full lifecycle in 23 countries shows that the focus on early-career earnings leads to underestimating the lifetime returns to skills by about one quarter. On average, a one-standard-deviation increase in numeracy skills is associated with an 18 percent wage increase among primeage workers. But this masks considerable heterogeneity across countries. Eight countries, including all Nordic countries, have returns between 12 and 15 percent, while six are above 21 percent with the largest return being 28 percent in the United States. Estimates are remarkably robust to different earnings and skill measures, additional controls, and various subgroups. Instrumental-variable models that use skill variation stemming from school attainment, parental education, or compulsory-schooling laws provide even higher estimates. Intriguingly, returns to skills are systematically lower in countries with higher union density, stricter employment protection, and larger public-sector shares.},

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between withinand between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

We hypothesize that low-skilled respondents are more likely than high-skilled respondents to refuse to participate in a follow-up wave. We analysed data from two assessment surveys in Germany with similar study designs, target populations, and assessment instruments. Results provide support for our hypothesis. Consistently across both surveys, respondents with the lowest literacy skills had a higher probability of refusal than those with the highest literacy skills.

  abstract = {During the past decade the Cattell\textendash Horn Gf\textendash Gc and Carroll Three-Stratum models have emerged as the consensus psychometric-based models for understanding the structure of human intelligence. Although the two models differ in a number of ways, the strong correspondence between the two models has resulted in the increased use of a broad umbrella term for a synthesis of the two models (Cattell\textendash Horn\textendash Carroll theory of cognitive abilities\textemdash CHC theory). The purpose of this editorial is three-fold. First, I will describe the CHC framework and recommend that intelligence researchers begin using the CHC taxonomy as a common nomenclature for describing research findings and a theoretical framework from which to test hypotheses regarding various aspects of human cognitive abilities. Second, I argue that the emergence of the CHC framework should not be viewed as the capstone to the psychometric era of factor analytic research. Rather, I recommend the CHC framework serve as the stepping stone to reinvigorate the investigation of the structure of human intelligence. Finally, the Woodcock-Mu\~noz Foundation Human Cognitive Abilities (HCA) project, which is an evolving, free, on-line electronic archive of the majority of datasets analyzed in Carroll's (1993) seminal treatise on factor analysis of human cognitive abilities, is introduced and described. Intelligence scholars are urged to access the Carroll HCA datasets to test and evaluate structural models of human intelligence with contemporary methods (confirmatory factor analysis). In addition, suggestions are offered for linking the analysis of contemporary data sets with the seminal work of Carroll. The emergence of a consensus CHC taxonomy and access to the original datasets analyzed by Carroll provides an unprecedented opportunity to extend and refine our understanding of human intelligence.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the link between age and proficiency in information-processing skills, based on information drawn from the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC). The data reveal significant age-related differences in proficiencies, strongly suggesting that proficiency tends to ``naturally'' decline with age. Age differences in proficiency are, at first sight, substantial. On average across the OECD countries participating in PIAAC, adults aged 55 to 65 score some 30 points less than adults aged 25 to 34 on the PIAAC literacy scale, which is only slightly smaller than the score point difference between tertiary educated and less-than-upper-secondary educated individuals. However, despite their lower levels of proficiency, older individuals do not seem to suffer in terms of labour market outcomes. In particular, they generally earn higher wages, and much of the available empirical evidence suggests that they are not less productive than younger workers. Older and more experienced individuals seem therefore able to compensate the decline in information processing skills with the development of other skills, generally much more difficult to measure. On the other hand, proficiency in information-processing skills remain a strong determinant of important outcomes at all ages: this makes it important to better understand which factors are the most effective in preventing such age-related decline in proficiency, which does not occur to the same extent in all countries and for all individuals. Two broad interventions seem to be particularly promising in this respect. First, it is important to ensure that there is adequate and effective investment in skills development early in the life-cycle: as skills beget skills, starting off with a higher stock of human capital seems also to ensure smaller rates of proficiency decline. Second, it is equally important that policies are in place that provide incentives to individuals (and firms) to invest in skills across the entire working life. In this respect, changes in retirement policies can not only have the short-term effect of providing some reliefs to public finance, but have the potential to radically reshape incentives to stay active, to practice their skills and to invest more in training, thus helping to maintain high levels of proficiency.},

The result of ordinary least square regression shows that although those with a higher level of educational attainment tend to have a higher level of literacy skills in all countries, countries substantially vary in the degree of literacy gaps by educational attainment. The crossnational variation in the literacy gap is mainly driven by between-country differences in the level of literacy skills among those who did not graduate from high school. The result of two-level hierarchical linear models, furthermore, shows that the cross-national variation in the literacy gap by educational attainment is in part attributable to between-country differences in standardization of educational systems and the extent to which adult education and training are offered to the low educated. We discuss theoretical and policy implications of the findings for addressing inequality of literacy skills.},

  abstract = {Practice engagement theory (PET) posits that individuals' literacy  proficiencies develop as a by-product of their engagement in everyday reading and writing practices and, reciprocally, that literacy proficiencies affect levels of engagement in reading and writing practices. This suggests that literacy training which increases engagement in meaningful practices might generate proficiency growth. Research has shown that this approach does indeed seem to be effective in improving (adult) learners' literacy proficiency. A number of cross-sectional comparisons of participants' and non-participants' performance in various training activities, as well as quantitative modelling of adults' proficiency growth in longitudinal studies have confirmed the theoretical assumptions of PET. The authors of this article describe the first application of PET to literacy and numeracy development in a longitudinal study of a nationally representative adult population. Their investigation followed a sample of adults initially interviewed and assessed in the German component of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), adding longitudinal data from three additional waves of the national extension study (PIAAC-L), which included repeated assessments of literacy and numeracy proficiency over a period of three years. The authors' quantitative modelling of the growth of literacy and numeracy proficiency over time provides strong support for PET. Their comparisons of how various practice engagement indexes predict growth of literacy and numeracy proficiencies indicate that reading engagement is the strongest predictor of literacy growth and maths engagement is the strongest predictor of numeracy growth. The authors conclude their article by considering their findings' implications for sustainable development, lifelong learning policy and future research into the development of adult literacy and numeracy proficiency.},

  abstract = {Although sensitive detection of pathological cognitive aging requires accurate information about the trajectory of normal cognitive aging, prior research has revealed inconsistent patterns of age-cognition relations with cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. Age trends in four cognitive domains were compared in over 5,000 adults with cross-sectional data, and in almost 1,600 adults with three-occasion longitudinal data. Quasi-longitudinal comparisons, which are similar to cross-sectional comparisons in that there is no prior test experience and are similar to longitudinal comparisons in that the participants are from the same birth cohorts, were also reported. The age trends in quasi-longitudinal comparisons more closely resembled those in cross-sectional comparisons than those in longitudinal comparisons, which suggests that, at least up until about age 65, age-cognition relations in longitudinal comparisons are distorted by prior test experience. Results from cross-sectional and quasi-longitudinal comparisons, which can be assumed to have minimal test experience effects, imply that normal cognitive aging is characterized by nearly linear declines from early adulthood in speed, and accelerating declines in memory and reasoning. However, vocabulary knowledge increased until the decade of the 60's in all three types of comparisons. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The present longitudinal study tackled 2 key aspects of the development of intelligence across a 40-year time period from age 12 to age 52 concerning (a) stability and change in the structure of intelligence with reference to the age differentiation-dedifferentiation hypothesis (how different cognitive abilities relate to each other across age) and (b) differential stabilities (the rank ordering of persons' intelligence levels across time). To this end, we drew on 2 structural conceptions of intelligence: (a) the extended Gf-Gc model to study broad cognitive abilities and (b) the 3-stratum model to decompose cognitive change into processes that are shared by all broad abilities (attributable to general cognitive ability g) and processes specific to a certain ability (independent of g). Data were obtained for 344 persons (56.4\% female). The results showed that people differ more greatly over time with respect to all broad abilities except for fluid reasoning, whereas the rank ordering of persons on all broad abilities remains remarkably stable. These combined results yielded substantial gap-widening effects from age 12 to age 52 years that were mainly accounted for by a substantial increase in g variance in combination with a high differential stability of g. Moreover, the increase in g variance reflects an increase in covariance among different broad abilities, which indicates that the different constructs relate more closely to each other at age 52 compared to age 12 (i.e., age dedifferentiation). Two theoretical explanations of this change in the structure of intelligence are discussed (common cause hypothesis and investment theory).},

It was approved by the International Conference on Education (Geneva, 1975), and was subsequently endorsed by UNESCO's General Conference when it adopted the Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Educational Statistics at its twentieth session (Paris, 1978). Experience over the years with the application of ISCED by national authorities and international organizations has shown the need for its updating and revision. This would further facilitate the international compilation and comparison of education statistics and take into account new developments and changes in education and anticipate future trends in the various regions of the world, such as the multiplication and growth of different forms of vocational education and training; the increasing diversity of education providers; and the increasing recourse to distance education and other modalities based on new technologies.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the degree to which British adults participating in workplace literacy courses improved their reading comprehension skills, using longitudinal data which cover the period from enrolment until between two and three years later. Learners were tested using an instrument designed explicitly for adults, with two parallel forms. For those who were native English speakers, there is no evidence of improvement. Learners for whom English was a second language showed modest but statistically significant improvements, but it is impossible to tell whether these were the result of instruction, or of subjects' longer exposure to an English-speaking environment. The data were re-analysed using imputed data, in order to address the problem of missing data, which is common in longitudinal studies, and using multilevel models. The results of these further analyses were the same in all key respects. These findings are important because improvement of adult literacy and numeracy skills has been central to successive governments' policies for improving both economic productivity and social mobility. Policy-makers have confounded the acquisition and award of certificates with substantive skill improvement. This study shows that one cannot, in fact, assume that the award of a new qualification indicates that substantive learning has taken place. It also underlines the complexity of reading skills, and the need for long periods of learning and instruction if serious progress is to be made.},
